# Glowing Potion

Really simple Fabric mod which adds a Potion of Glowing brewed
with a glow ink sac. Now glow squids are a bit more useful.

Curseforge:  
Modrinth: 

(Does not need the Fabric API)

## Using the potion
The potion of glowing is surprisingly useful; you can:
  - Locate friends lost in caves, forests...
  - Make a trap so that intruders can be seen through walls.
  - Throw a splash potion of glowing to a wall in order to see if somebody is in there.
  - Etc.

## Permissions
You can do whatever you want with this lol, it's like 20 lines of code.

If you want this potion in your favourite vanilla+ mod, you can probably get the devs to add it 
if you ask nicely since it's so simple. If you're one of those devs and have included the potion
to your mod, tell me and I'll add a link to your mod in this README.
